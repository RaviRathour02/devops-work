1.Insall the dependencies--
sudo yum install automake fuse fuse-devel gcc-c++ git libcurl-devel libxml2-devel make openssl-devel

3.Install the code
cd s3fs-fuse
./autogen.sh

5. Getting the access key and secret key.
****You will need an AWS Access key and Secret key with appropriate permissions in order to access your s3 bucket from your EC2 instance.
-Create an IAM user with S3 full access
-Go to AWS Menu -> Your AWS Account Name -> My Security Credentials. Here your IAM console will appear.
-Now go to the Security Credentials Tab and Create an Access Key.

touch /etc/passwd-s3fs
vim /etc/passwd-s3fs

(Your_accesskey:Your_secretkey)  --- inside

7. Change the permission of the file
sudo chmod 640 /etc/passwd-s3fs

8. Mount S3 bucket
mkdir /mys3bucket
s3fs your_bucketname -o use_cache=/tmp -o allow_other -o uid=1001 -o mp_umask=002 -o multireq_max=5 /mys3bucket

you can make an entry in /etc/rc.local to automatically remount after reboot.  Find the s3fs binary file by the “which” command and make the entry before the “exit 0” line as below.
which s3fs
/usr/local/bin/s3fs
nano /etc/rc.local
/usr/local/bin/s3fs your_bucketname -o use_cache=/tmp -o allow_other -o uid=1001 -o mp_umask=002 -o multireq_max=5 /mys3bucket
